# Sisyphus
A minimal nvim config drawn inspiration of Greek Mythical creature Sisyphus, who was condemned to roll a boulder uphill for eternity, symbolizing the absurdity of human existence.

# Motivation
It is a reminder for pursuit of refining our tools, knowing that perfection is unattainable yet striving for improvement nonetheless. This Neovim configuration embracesthe ethos of embracing the absurdity of our efforts while finding meaning in the process.
